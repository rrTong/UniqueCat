# UniqueCat
**What's the point?**

To check uniqueness of a new [royalrion](https://www.instagram.com/royalrion/) instagram caption

## How to use
Check if royalrion has used cat caption
```
rion.py "test cat"
```
Or just check caption without "cat"!
```
rion.py "test"
```
---
UniqueCat will tell you either
```
"test cat" already exists!
```
or
```
u haven't used "test cat" yet!
```
